# Next.js To-Do List

Minimal Next.js to-do list app scaffolded inside `to-do-list/`.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd to-do-list
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs on http://localhost:3001 by default.

Features:
- Add, toggle, delete todos
- Persists todos to localStorage
- Simple responsive UI

Notes:
- This scaffold uses Next 14 with TypeScript files. If you prefer JavaScript, rename `.tsx` files to `.jsx` and adjust `package.json`.
